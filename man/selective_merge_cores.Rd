\title{Selectively merge overlapping cores based on score difference.}
\usage{
selective_merge_cores(core_gr, score_diff)
}
\arguments{
\item{core_gr}{A GRanges object containing genomic core ranges.}

\item{score_diff}{A numeric value specifying the maximum allowed
score difference for merging overlapping cores.}
}
\value{
A GRanges object with merged core regions and added
metadata, including the thick position and maximum score.
}
\description{
This function takes a GRanges object of genomic cores, sorts them
by descending score, and merges overlapping cores if their score
difference is within a specified threshold.
