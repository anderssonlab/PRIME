\title{Generate Sliding Windows for a Single Chromosome}
\usage{
tc_sliding_window_chr(gr_per_chr, sld_by = 20, ext_dis = 200)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr_per_chr}{A `GRanges` object containing ranges
for a single chromosome,
representing reduced and uniformly extended tag clusters (TCs).}

\item{sld_by}{Integer. Sliding window step size in base pairs (default: 20).}

\item{ext_dis}{Integer. Number of base pairs to expand the window
on both sides (default: 200).}
}
\value{
A `GRanges` object containing all expanded sliding windows
for the input chromosome.
}
\description{
This function creates sliding windows over a single chromosome's
reduced tag cluster regions (as `GRanges`), typically generated from
extended CTSS clusters. Each window is centered at regular intervals
and then expanded on both ends by a specified distance.
}
\details{
It is designed to be called internally for each chromosome by
`plc_tc_sliding_window()` and should not require strand specificity.
}
\examples{
gr_chr <- GenomicRanges::GRanges(
  seqnames = "chr1",
  ranges = IRanges::IRanges(start = c(100, 200), end = c(150, 250))
)
windows <- tc_sliding_window_chr(gr_chr, sld_by = 20, ext_dis = 200)
