\title{Configure Python environment for PRIMEloci}
\usage{
configure_plc_python(
  python_path = "~/.virtualenvs/prime-env",
  log_target = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{python_path}{Path to Python binary, virtualenv, or conda environment.}

\item{log_target}{Path to a log file for output (optional).}
}
\value{
Python configuration object from `reticulate::py_config()`
}
\description{
Sets and verifies the Python environment
to be used in the PRIMEloci pipeline.
This includes specifying a path to a Python binary,
virtual environment, or conda environment,
checking for required Python packages and their versions,
and ensuring runtime compatibility.
}
\details{
In addition to package version checks,
this function performs a runtime test to verify
that `scipy.sparse.save_npz()` works correctly through `reticulate`.
This prevents downstream failures during profile saving
if Python is misconfigured, especially when
using system Python without setting `RETICULATE_PYTHON` early in the session.
