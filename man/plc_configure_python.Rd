\title{Configure Python environment for PRIMEloci}
\usage{
plc_configure_python(python_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{python_path}{Path to Python binary, virtualenv, or conda environment.}
}
\value{
Python configuration object from `reticulate::py_config()`
}
\description{
Sets and verifies the Python environment
to be used in the PRIMEloci pipeline.
This includes specifying a path to a Python binary,
virtual environment, or conda environment,
checking for required Python packages and their versions,
and ensuring runtime compatibility.
}
\details{
In addition to package version checks,
this function performs a runtime test to verify
that `scipy.sparse.save_npz()` works correctly through `reticulate`.
This prevents downstream failures during profile saving
if Python is misconfigured, especially when
using system Python without setting `RETICULATE_PYTHON` early in the session.
